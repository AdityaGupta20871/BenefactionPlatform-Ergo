          <p>This website is an open-source UI for interacting with the Ergo blockchain. It directly interfaces with smart contracts on the Ergo blockchain, enabling project owners to raise funds for their initiatives and allowing users to contribute to these projects.</p>
          
          <p class="font-bold mt-4">Please note:</p>
          <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
              <li>In the case of a successful project, meaning the minimum funding threshold has been met, there is no guarantee that the project owners will fulfill their stated goals. This website is solely a tool to connect projects with contributors.</li>
              <li>
                  A contribution can only be refunded if both of the following conditions are met:
                  <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2">
                      <li>The set deadline has passed.</li>
                      <li>The fundraising target has not been reached.</li>
                  </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                  Project funds can only be withdrawn by the project owners if the following condition is met:
                  <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2">
                      <li>The fundraising target has been reached.</li>
                  </ul>
              </li>
              <li>A 5% developer fee is applied to all successfully funded projects. This fee is sent to a designated developer address when the project owner withdraws the funds.</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="font-bold mt-4">Additionally:</p>
          <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
              <li>Each project operates with two tokens: "APT" (Auxiliary Project Token) and "PFT" (Proof-Funding Token). APT allows users to request refunds if applicable. When the deadline has passed and the minimum funding goal has been reached, users can exchange APT for PFT. This design accommodates cases where PFT may be used across multiple projects or held in reserves by project creators.</li>
              <li>This website does not log, collect, profile, share, or sell your data.</li>
              <li>Bene operates on a blockchain. Therefore, transactions are final and irreversible once they achieve "confirmed" status.</li>
              <li>All transactions are viewable through Ergo's Explorers.</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="mt-4">There is no guarantee against bugs or errors.</p>
